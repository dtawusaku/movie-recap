- I name this project movies-wrapped, then changed to movie-review to movie-recap. Was looking for a good nameðŸ˜…

- Initially, when i had this idea, i thought of webscraping as my data source. I learnt web scraping and it some problems. Webs scraping is and will be slow for the project and to top it off, the site(IMDb) I intended to use as my data source restricted webscraping.
- I then found out about web scraping APIs. signup for one and learnt how to use it, but I still wasn't comfortable. I didn't really know how to use it and problems like movie search, or thee possibility or an inappropriate result came up. Well, I got tired and frustrated and almost called quits until I went to Kaggle to do some finding.
- I found exactly what i was looking for and the best part is that, the datasets always get updated. Well on Kaggle. I linked the data sources.
- Then,
